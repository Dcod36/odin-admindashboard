# Admin Dashboard

This project is an **Admin Dashboard layout** built as part of the **Intermediate HTML and CSS** course from **The Odin Project**.

The goal of this project was to practice:
- CSS Grid for overall page layout
- Nested grids and flexbox for components
- Semantic HTML structure
- Building a dashboard-style UI from a design reference

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The dashboard includes:
- A fixed sidebar with navigation
- A header with search, user info, and action buttons
- A main content area with:
  - Project cards arranged in a grid
  - Announcements section
  - Trending users section

The layout closely follows the design provided in the Odin Project curriculum, focusing on structure and layout rather than pixel-perfect accuracy.

## 🤖 Use of AI

Limited use of AI (ChatGPT) was made during this project for:
